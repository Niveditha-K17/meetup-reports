# General stuff (bring in the context of hacktoberfest)

- Pick a monthly mid-size project
  - REASONING: Learning to work with projects with not so much accessibility
  - THOUGHT: Could target projects with maintainers who merge PR's but don't work on it actively
    - mentioned: ferdi
  - Exposure to non-code
  - DISCUSSED: monthly themes
    - maybe better to mention the domain/category and leave it at that

- Fixed meetup slot every weekend, we do it without an opt-in
  - show a mid-size project we found (start with our own, then expand)
  - live demo the contribution process and us working on the code (improv it)
  - demos on anything/anything fun
  - CONDUCT: give something to look forward to
  - CONDUCT: involve the participants
  - CONDUCT: Take feedback
  - CONDUCT: Give some metadata - specifically about what new thing you will learn in the session
  - CONDUCT: Record it (OBS?)
    - *Add timestamps* and upload it

- Record explainer/something videos
  - these can be edited

- Le slot machine queue for meetup scheduling
  - Online interface to submit meetup proposals, schedule and announce them flamboyantly
    - start with manual selection
  - We can stream the development of this or make a project out of this

- PESOS Twitch?????!!????
